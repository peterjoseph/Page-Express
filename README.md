Page Express Framework is a flexible wordpress theme designed to make creating a unique website easy and efficient.

The long term goal is to produce a platform that provides fantastic marketing tools in a simple package, so you can produce pages that convert with minimal effort.

A large collection of options are provided from the customiser panel.

Installation
------------
Create a new folder in the wordpress wp-content/themes directory and copy all files from Master.

Functionality
-------------
GitHub source code includes all of the features that are actively being developed. As a result, much of the functionality may be incomplete or unstable. This is certainly not suitable for production.

As production ready releases become available, they will be made available through the website and wordpress update channels integrated in the product.

To-Do / Ideas
-------------
 - Google Fonts Support
 - Integrate Bootstrap 4
 - WooCommerce
